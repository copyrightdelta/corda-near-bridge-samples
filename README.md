# corda-near-bridge-samples

This repository contains Corda code samples of our Corda<->Near Bridge where we use Hash Locking to ensure the digital asset can only be used on one blockchain at a time, keeping things synchronized.

With the first milestone from the Near Grant, we discovered that the NFT SDK from our partner did not have enough functionality for this hash locking mechanism. We are planning to run our own fullnode at Blockdaemon with institutional grade resilience. 

With the second milestone, we will be allowing the licensing and streaming of music through a NFT as license with decentralized file storage. This naturally contains more public open sourcable code.
